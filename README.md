# Task
Create a mini test framework with one test that will launch any ecommerce site such as takealot, woolworths, ebay and automate the following steps:

1 - Launch website

2 - Add any item to the cart

3 - Verify the correct item has been added to the cart
**(EXAMPLE: If you added a Samsung Fridge to the cart, you will need to verify that the correct Samsung Fridge was added to the cart)**

**All code needs to be committed to this git repository. (If you are struggling with git then a ZIP file needs to be emailed to me)**

# Bonus Points
- If done in Typescript (not compulsory, can be done in any language you are comfortable with).
- If committed to a seperate branch and not just pushed to master branch (not compulsory).
